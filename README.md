# This is the implementation of paper "Universal Background Subtraction based on Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network"

## Running environment 
Anaconda + Pytorch

## How to run the code
We provided a shell script `run_demo.sh` to run our code. It is a demo of using ADNNet (Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network) for background subtraction. Morever, `run_ADNNvsCNN.sh` proposed a comparison between the ADNNet and CNNet (convolutional neural network) in background subtraction, for more comparison results, please check our paper. In addition, folder `verification` provided a verfication of the ADNNet.
