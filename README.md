# This is the implementation of paper "Universal Background Subtraction based on Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network"

## Running environment 
Anaconda + Pytorch

## How to run the code
We provided a shell script `run_demo.sh` to run our code. It is a demo of using ADNNet (Arithmetic Distribution Neural Network) for background subtraction. Then, `run_universal.sh` provided a pre-trained model which is trained with less than 1\% of ground truth frames from the CDNet2014 dataset but tested for all videos from CDNet2014, LASIESTA, and SBMI2015 datasets. For more details, please check our paper. Moreover, `run_ADNNvsCNN.sh` proposed a comparison between the ADNNet and CNNet (convolutional neural network) in background subtraction, for more comparison results, please check our paper. In addition, folder `verification` provided the verification of the ADNNet.
